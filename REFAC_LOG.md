# Refactor & Enhancement Log

## 2024-06-06

### Initial Backup
- Backed up all files in `src/modern/src/components/shared/` and `src/modern/src/data/serviceData.ts` to the `backups/` directory.
- This ensures we can revert any changes to shared UI components or service data if needed.

---

### ServiceCard.tsx Documentation
- Added JSDoc-style documentation for the component and its props.
- Added a warning comment about dynamic Tailwind class names for gradients and suggested a mapping approach for production.
- No logic changes made; UI should remain unchanged.

---

### BasePopup.tsx Documentation
- Added JSDoc-style documentation for the component and its props.
- Added a note about the design intent for visual consistency with the app's modals/popups.
- No logic changes made; UI should remain unchanged.

---

### ServiceIcons.tsx Documentation
- Added JSDoc-style documentation for the ServiceIcons object.
- Added usage and naming notes for maintainability.
- No logic changes made; UI should remain unchanged.

### serviceData.ts Documentation & Typing
- Added JSDoc-style documentation for the file and its usage.
- Added a Service interface for type safety and applied it to all service arrays.
- Added notes on how to add new services.
- No logic changes made; UI should remain unchanged.

#### Refactor Start: services.tsx
- Backed up `src/modern/src/components/services.tsx` to `backups/services.tsx.bak.<timestamp>`.
- Created `refactor_docs/services.md` for detailed documentation and design reference.
- Will extract and document components/utilities incrementally, with visual/UI checks after each change.
